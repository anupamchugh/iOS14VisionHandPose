# iOS14VisionHandPose
The new `VNDetectHumanHandPoseRequest` is an image-based vision request that detects a human hand pose. 
In this project, I've leveraged that to detect hand pose gestures(👎 or 👍) for swiping left or right — because in 2020, it's OK to be lazy and practice social distancing with our phones.
